# Typrfr (WiP)

TUI for typeracing using [tview](https://github.com/rivo/tview). Uses `TCP` rather than relying on `HTTPS` or `Websockets` etc. Everything right now is stored in memory as no plan of publishing it to a server maybe a local binary for offline mode only.

# Todo
- [ ] Text highlight when typing
- [x] Creating and joining rooms
- [ ] Render game stats for all users


# Server 

- use `air` to run the development server for now.
