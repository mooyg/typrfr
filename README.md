# Typrfr (WiP)

TUI for typeracing using [tview](https://github.com/rivo/tview). Uses `TCP` rather than relying on `HTTPS` or `Websockets` etc. Everything right now is stored in memory as no plan of publishing it to a server maybe a local binary for offline mode only.

# Todo
- [] Text highlight when typing
- [] Creating and joining rooms
